EDDG - MUENSTER OSNABRUECK AIRPORT
----------------------------------------

How to install the scenery?

Copy or unzip all files and put it in the following directory:
Flightgear -> data -> Scenery -> Objects -> e000n50 -> e007n52

Be sure that you replace the stg-file named "3072906" otherwise it won't work later.
Have fun with many flights Muenster.

If there are question or problems you can mail me in Lukas' Flightgear Hangar.
